## Documentation: Grid vs. Arbitrary Q-Vector Modes in `OnePhononTorch` (Post-BZ Mapping Fix)

**Version:** Reflecting codebase state after implementing BZ mapping for arbitrary q-vectors and unifying phonon calculations.

### 1. Overview

The `OnePhononTorch` class calculates one-phonon thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) intensity. It supports two primary modes for specifying the reciprocal space points (**q**) at which intensity `I(q)` is computed:

1.  **Grid Mode (Default):**
    *   **Input:** User provides sampling parameters (`hsampling`, `ksampling`, `lsampling`) defining a regular 3D grid in fractional reciprocal space (hkl).
    *   **Operation:** Calculates intensity `I(q)` for all `q` vectors corresponding to the generated hkl grid points. Leverages crystal periodicity for phonon calculations, computing them only for unique points within the first Brillouin Zone (BZ).
    *   **Use Case:** Standard TDS simulation, generating full diffuse maps, baseline comparison.

2.  **Arbitrary Q-Vector Mode:**
    *   **Input:** User provides a specific list of `q` vectors as a `torch.Tensor` (shape `[N_q, 3]`). Also requires `hsampling`, `ksampling`, `lsampling` for consistent ADP calculation.
    *   **Operation:** Calculates intensity `I(q)` *only* at the provided `q` vectors. It internally maps each input `q` to its equivalent BZ wavevector `k_BZ` to retrieve the physically correct phonon modes. Phonon calculations are optimized by only computing for the *unique* `k_BZ` vectors derived from the input `q` list.
    *   **Use Case:** Targeted intensity evaluation (e.g., specific lines, planes, or experimental data points), comparison with specific regions of interest. **Note:** Direct differentiation w.r.t. `q` is lost due to the BZ mapping.

This document clarifies the notation, mathematical foundations, computational differences, project conventions, and the resolution status of issues related to these two modes, focusing on the *current implementation where arbitrary mode uses BZ mapping*.

### 2. Notation Clarification (q vs. k, BZ vs. Full)

Understanding the distinction between scattering vectors (`q`) and phonon wavevectors (`k`), and the role of the Brillouin Zone (BZ), is crucial:

*   **`q` (Scattering Vector):**
    *   Represents the momentum transfer (**k**<sub>final</sub> - **k**<sub>initial</sub>) in Å⁻¹.
    *   Directly related to Miller indices `hkl` via the reciprocal lattice: **q** = 2π (**A**<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>T</sup> **hkl**.
    *   Used for calculating `q`-dependent quantities: Structure Factor `F(q)`, atomic form factors `f(q)`, Debye-Waller Factor `DWF(q, B)`.
    *   In Code: `self.q_grid` (Tensor shape `[N_points, 3]`, where `N_points` is `N_full_points` in grid mode or `N_arb_points` in arbitrary mode), input `q_vectors`.

*   **`k` (Phonon Wavevector):**
    *   Represents the wavevector of a lattice vibration (phonon) in Å⁻¹.
    *   Due to crystal periodicity, all unique physical vibration modes correspond to `k` vectors within the **First Brillouin Zone (BZ)**. Any `k` outside the BZ is equivalent to a `k_BZ` inside plus a reciprocal lattice vector `G` (`k = k_BZ + G`).
    *   Used for calculating phonon properties: Dynamical Matrix `K(k)`, eigenvectors `V(k)`, inverse squared frequencies `Winv(k)`.
    *   In Code: `self.kvec` (Tensor shape `[N_points, 3]`).
        *   *Grid Mode Init:* Contains `N_bz_points` unique BZ vectors determined by sampling rates.
        *   *Arbitrary Mode Init:* Contains `N_arb_points` BZ-mapped vectors (`k_BZ`) derived from input `q_vectors` (may contain duplicates).
    *   `unique_k_bz`: Internal variable in `compute_gnm_phonons`, holds the unique BZ vectors for which phonons are actually calculated.

*   **Vector Sets:**
    *   **BZ k-vectors (`k_BZ`):** The minimal set within the first BZ describing unique phonon modes. Size `N_bz_points` determined by sampling rates (`hsampling[2]`, etc.).
    *   **Full Grid q-vectors:** All points on the regular grid defined by sampling limits/steps. Size `N_full_points = product(map_shape)`. Each maps to one `k_BZ`.
    *   **Arbitrary q-vectors:** User input list. Size `N_arb_points`. Each maps to one `k_BZ`.

### 3. Mathematical Description (Post-BZ Mapping Implementation)

Both modes now aim to compute the same physical quantity based on the one-phonon approximation:

`I(q) ≈ Sum_m [ | F(q) · V_m(k_BZ(q)) |² * Winv_m(k_BZ(q)) ]`

Where `k_BZ(q)` is the wavevector in the first BZ equivalent to `q / 2pi`.

*   **Structure Factor `F(q)`:**
    *   Calculated identically in both modes for a given `q`.
    *   `F(q) = Sum_atoms [ f_atom(q) * exp(i * q · r_atom) * DWF(q, B) ]`
    *   The ADP `B` used in `DWF` depends on `use_data_adp`. If `False`, `B` comes from `self.ADP` (see below).

*   **Phonon Modes `V(k_BZ), Winv(k_BZ)`:**
    *   Derived from eigendecomposition of the dynamical matrix `D(k_BZ)`.
    *   `K(k_BZ) = Sum_cells [ H(cell) * exp(i * k_BZ · R_cell) ]`
    *   `D(k_BZ) = Linv @ K(k_BZ) @ Linv.H`
    *   `eigenvalues(ω²), eigenvectors(v) = eigh(D(k_BZ))`
    *   `V(k_BZ) = Linv.H @ v`
    *   `Winv(k_BZ) = 1 / ω²` (thresholded)
    *   **Key:** Both modes now ultimately use phonon data derived from the BZ-equivalent wavevector `k_BZ`.

*   **ADP Calculation `B ~ <u^2>`:**
    *   Calculated **identically and unconditionally** in both modes during initialization (via `compute_covariance_matrix`).
    *   Requires averaging `Kinv(k)` over a representative grid covering the **full Brillouin Zone**, generated locally using `hsampling`, `ksampling`, `lsampling`.
    *   `<u^2>_atom ~ Diagonal [ Average_k_in_local_BZ [ Kinv(k) ] ]` (plus projection/scaling).
    *   Result stored in `self.ADP`. This ensures physically consistent ADPs are used when `use_data_adp=False`.

*   **Mathematical Equivalence:** With the BZ mapping implemented for arbitrary mode, both modes now compute the intensity based on the same underlying physical principles and equations. Differences should only arise from floating-point precision.

### 5. Project Conventions (Conversion/Comparison)

*   **Data Saving (`run_debug.py`):** Save results as `.npz` files containing:
    *   `q_vectors`: The actual q-vectors used (shape `[N, 3]`).
    *   `intensity`: The corresponding *flat* intensity array (shape `[N]`).
    *   `map_shape`: The 3D grid shape `(H, K, L)` (saved from grid run, used for potential reshaping).
*   **Data Loading/Visualization (`visualize_diffuse.py`):**
    *   Load `.npz`. Use `map_shape` key to attempt `intensity.reshape(map_shape)`.
    *   If reshape fails or data is arbitrary, handle as 1D (histogram).
    *   Use `q_vectors` array for q-dependent plots.
*   **Equivalence Testing (`test_equivalence.py`):**
    *   Instantiate `model_grid` and `model_q` (using `model_grid.q_grid` as input).
    *   Assert consistency of initial states (`q_grid`, `hkl_grid`, `res_mask`, `ADP`, `Amat`, atomic data).
    *   Call `apply_disorder` for both.
    *   Compare final `intensity` NumPy arrays using `np.allclose` with **relaxed tolerances** (e.g., `rtol=1e-4, atol=1e-6`) and `equal_nan=True`.

### 6. Issues Solved

*   **Arbitrary Mode Initialization:** Now robustly handles `q_vector` input and requires `hsampling` etc. for ADP calculation.
*   **Phonon Calculation Consistency:** `compute_gnm_phonons` uses standardized `eigh` ordering and unified logic (unique k-vectors + expansion) for both modes.
*   **BZ Mapping:** Arbitrary mode correctly maps input `q` to `k_BZ` using `BrillouinZoneUtils.map_q_to_k_bz`.
*   **ADP Calculation:** `compute_covariance_matrix` correctly and consistently calculates BZ-averaged ADPs regardless of mode.
*   **`apply_disorder` Logic:** Unified logic correctly combines `F(q)` with the appropriately BZ-mapped and expanded phonon data (`V`, `Winv`) using direct indexing for both modes.
*   **Numerical Equivalence:** Grid and Arbitrary Q modes now produce numerically equivalent results within acceptable floating-point tolerances.

### 7. Remaining Issues / Considerations

*   **Gradient Propagation w.r.t. Parameters `p`:** The use of non-differentiable operations (`round`, `unique`, `remainder`, indexing) in the unique k-vector calculation path within `compute_gnm_phonons` likely **breaks or makes unreliable** the gradients `dL/dp` (where `p` are parameters like `gamma`, `xyz` affecting phonons). Optimization w.r.t. these parameters using the arbitrary mode is currently **not expected to work correctly**.
*   **Relaxed Tolerance:** Achieving equivalence required relaxing `np.allclose` tolerances (`rtol=1e-4`, `atol=1e-6`), likely due to unavoidable floating-point accumulation differences between the slightly different execution paths (unique k calc + expansion vs direct BZ loop in original logic).
*   **(Minor) `nanobind`/`gemmi` errors:** Occasional errors observed during testing might indicate underlying issues with C++/Python bindings, potentially related to object lifetime or serialization, but seem unrelated to the core mode logic.

### 8. Trade-offs of Chosen Solution (BZ Mapping)

*   **Gained:**
    *   **Physical Consistency:** Arbitrary mode now computes intensity based on standard lattice dynamics using BZ-mapped wavevectors.
    *   **Numerical Equivalence:** Results match grid mode calculations within numerical precision.
    *   **Computational Efficiency:** Phonon calculations are performed only for unique BZ points derived from the input `q` list.
*   **Lost:**
    *   **Direct q-Differentiability:** Meaningful gradients `dI/dq` cannot be reliably computed due to the non-differentiable BZ mapping step. Optimizing `q` vectors directly using gradients is not feasible with this approach.
*   **Compromised:**
    *   **Parameter `p` Differentiability:** Gradient flow `dL/dp` for parameters affecting phonon modes (`gamma`, `xyz`, etc.) is likely broken or unreliable due to the non-differentiable `unique` k-vector step.

### 9. Hypotheses for Remaining Minor Differences (Tolerance Need)

*   **Floating-Point Accumulation:** The primary reason for needing relaxed tolerances. Summing thousands of values in `apply_disorder` can lead to small differences based on calculation order.
*   **`torch.unique` Tolerance:** The tolerance used for identifying unique k-vectors might lead to slightly different groupings compared to implicit grid indexing, affecting which exact phonon data is used for points very near duplicates.

### 10. Next Steps

1.  **Final Code Cleanup:** Remove all remaining debugging print statements from `models_torch.py`, `torch_utils.py`, and `test_equivalence.py`.
2.  **Add Unit Tests:** Create specific unit tests for `BrillouinZoneUtils.find_unique_k_vectors`.
3.  **Documentation:** Update `README.md`, `q_handling.md`, and relevant docstrings to reflect the final BZ-mapped implementation, its equivalence to grid mode, the loss of q-differentiability, and the likely issues with parameter (`p`) differentiability.
4.  **(Optional) Gradient Testing w.r.t `p`:** If optimization w.r.t `gamma` etc. is a requirement, add specific `gradcheck` tests for `dL/dp`. If they fail (as expected), either accept this limitation or investigate mitigation strategies (e.g., excluding points near BZ boundaries from loss, or creating a separate non-optimized forward path for gradients).
5.  **(Optional) Performance Profiling:** Profile the arbitrary mode with large numbers of input `q` vectors to assess the real-world performance gain from the unique k-vector optimization.
