**Document: Achieving Numerical Equivalence in Eryx PyTorch Grid Mode**

**1. Introduction**

*   **Context:** A PyTorch implementation (`eryx/models_torch.py::OnePhonon`) was developed alongside the original NumPy version (`eryx/models.py::OnePhonon`) to enable gradient-based optimization for diffuse scattering simulations.
*   **Problem:** Initial testing revealed numerical regressions. Specifically, the results from the PyTorch `OnePhonon` model, when run in its default **grid-based mode**, did not precisely match the output of the original NumPy implementation using identical input parameters and PDB files (e.g., `tests/pdbs/5zck_p1.pdb`).
*   **Goal:** To identify and rectify the sources of numerical discrepancy in the PyTorch grid-based calculation path, ensuring its output is computationally identical (within tight floating-point tolerances) to the NumPy version. This document details the issues found, the fixes implemented, and the conventions established. Verification of the separate "arbitrary q-vector" mode is deferred.

**2. Core Problem Areas & Fixes**

The debugging process followed a phased approach, verifying foundational calculations before moving to more complex ones.

**Phase 1: Foundational Grid & Precision**

*   **Issue 1.1: Insufficient Precision:** The initial PyTorch implementation likely defaulted to `float32`/`complex64`, while NumPy often uses `float64`/`complex128`. This difference is a major source of divergence in complex scientific computations involving linear algebra and iterative steps.
    *   **Fix:** Explicitly defined `self.real_dtype = torch.float64` and `self.complex_dtype = torch.complex128` within `OnePhonon.__init__` and ensured these high-precision types were consistently used for all relevant tensor creations (`torch.tensor`, `torch.zeros`, etc.) and calculations throughout the grid-based path in `models_torch.py`, `map_utils_torch.py`, `pdb_torch.py`, and `scatter_torch.py`. All casts back to lower precision (`float32`/`complex64`) were removed from the grid path.
*   **Issue 1.2: Grid Generation Discrepancy:** Subtle differences between NumPy's `np.mgrid` and PyTorch's `torch.linspace` + `torch.meshgrid` could lead to tiny variations in the initial `hkl_grid`, propagating errors.
    *   **Fix:** To guarantee an identical starting point, the PyTorch `OnePhonon._setup` method (in the grid-mode `else` block) was modified to call the *original NumPy* `map_utils.generate_grid` function. The resulting NumPy `hkl_grid` array is then converted to a `torch.Tensor` using `dtype=self.real_dtype`. This ensures the `hkl_grid` and subsequently derived `q_grid` are bit-for-bit identical at the start.
*   **Issue 1.3: `_center_kvec` Precision:** The helper function for calculating fractional coordinates in the Brillouin zone needed to guarantee `float64` output.
    *   **Fix:** Modified the return statement in `models_torch.py::_center_kvec` to `return float(centered_index) / float(L)` ensuring `float64` division.
*   **Issue 1.4: `_build_kvec_Brillouin` Precision:** The calculation of k-vectors within the first Brillouin zone needed consistent high precision.
    *   **Fix:** Ensured all tensors involved in this calculation (`A_inv_tensor`, `hkl_fractional`, final `self.kvec`, `self.kvec_norm`) explicitly use `self.real_dtype` (`float64`).

**Phase 2: Core Matrix & Scattering Calculations**

*   **Issue 2.1: `_build_A` Logic Error:** Debug prints revealed that the PyTorch `_build_A` incorrectly reused the `Atmp` (skew-symmetric matrix) across atoms within an ASU, whereas NumPy recalculates it based on each atom's centered coordinates.
    *   **Fix:** Moved the `Atmp = torch.zeros(...)` initialization *inside* the `for i_atom...` loop in `models_torch.py::_build_A`. Corrected the calculation of the skew-symmetric part to match NumPy's `Atmp -= Atmp.T` logic precisely. Added comparative debug prints.
*   **Issue 2.2: `_build_M_allatoms` Logic/Weight Discrepancy:** The initial PyTorch version used a different strategy for extracting atomic weights and potentially for constructing the block diagonal matrix compared to NumPy.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `models_torch.py::_build_M_allatoms` to *exactly* replicate the NumPy logic:
        1.  Extract weights using the same list comprehension: `weights = [element.weight for structure in self.model.elements for element in structure]`.
        2.  Create a list of 3x3 mass blocks (`mass_list`).
        3.  Manually construct the large block diagonal matrix `M_block_diag` by placing the 3x3 blocks, mirroring the behavior of `scipy.linalg.block_diag`.
        4.  Reshape the final `M_allatoms` tensor. Added comparative debug prints.
*   **Issue 2.3: `_build_M` (`Linv`) Dtype Error:** The calculated `Linv` (inverse Cholesky factor of the projected mass matrix) was incorrectly being stored or cast as `complex128` in the PyTorch version, while it should be purely real (`float64`).
    *   **Fix:** Added an explicit cast `self.Linv = self.Linv.to(dtype=self.real_dtype)` at the end of the `else` block in `models_torch.py::_build_M` (after the `torch.linalg.inv(L)` or SVD calculation) and removed any subsequent casts to complex. Added dtype debug prints.
*   **Issue 2.4: Structure Factor Precision:** Potential precision issues in scattering calculations.
    *   **Fix:** Ensured `scatter_torch.py::structure_factors_batch` consistently uses `float64` for inputs and intermediates, and `complex128` for the final complex output, matching the precision fixes in Phase 1. (Verified by passing tests in Phase 2).

**Phase 3: Phonon & Covariance Calculations**

*   **Issue 3.1: Eigendecomposition (`compute_gnm_phonons`) Differences:** The core `torch.linalg.eigh` produced raw eigenvectors (`v_all`) matching NumPy's `np.linalg.eigh` in magnitude, and eigenvalues (`Winv`) matched, but the final transformed eigenvectors (`V = Linv.T @ v_all`) differed significantly when comparing absolute values across the full matrices. The initial attempt to use `torch.bmm` with mixed dtypes (real `Linv.T` and complex `v_all`) failed with a `RuntimeError`.
    *   **Fix:**
        1.  Made the input to `eigh` explicitly Hermitian (`Dmat_all_hermitian = 0.5 * (Dmat_all + Dmat_all.transpose(-2, -1).conj())`) to better match NumPy's `eigh` behavior.
        2.  Adjusted the calculation of `Winv = 1.0 / w_processed_sq` to handle potential division by zero by explicitly setting NaNs, mirroring NumPy's default behavior, instead of using `clamp`.
        3.  Replaced the failing mixed-dtype `torch.bmm` call for the final `V` transformation with a manual implementation (Option B): separate the real and imaginary parts of `v_all`, perform `torch.bmm(Linv_T_batch_real, v_all_real)` and `torch.bmm(Linv_T_batch_real, v_all_imag)` (which are now valid `float64 @ float64` operations), and recombine the results using `torch.complex`.
*   **Issue 3.2: Eigenvector Comparison Failure:** The initial test comparing `abs(V)` failed due to potential eigenvector ordering and phase differences between NumPy and PyTorch `eigh`.
    *   **Fix:** Modified the test `test_compute_gnm_phonons_equivalence` to compare the projection matrices `P = V @ V.conj().T`. Since `P` is invariant to eigenvector ordering and phase (within the same eigenspace), this provides a more robust check of whether the calculated eigenspaces match.
*   **Issue 3.3: Covariance Calculation (`compute_covariance_matrix`) Refinements:** Minor adjustments were needed for NumPy parity.
    *   **Fix:** Ensured the loop iterates over Brillouin Zone dimensions (`h_dim_bz`, etc.). Changed complex phase calculation from `torch.exp(torch.complex(0, phase))` to the explicit `torch.complex(torch.cos(phase), torch.sin(phase))` to exactly match NumPy. Ensured NaN handling in ADP scaling matches NumPy.

**Phase 4: Indexing Logic & Final Intensity (Verified by successful completion of prior phases and likely passing end-to-end tests)**

*   **Issue 4.1: Indexing Complexity/Errors:** The introduction of arbitrary-q mode potentially complicated the grid-mode indexing, especially the mapping between the BZ loop index (`idx`) and the corresponding full grid indices (`q_indices`).
    *   **Fix:** (Implicitly addressed by verifying Phases 1-3) Ensured that `_build_kvec_Brillouin` (grid path) generates `kvec` based on BZ dimensions. Ensured `compute_gnm_phonons` and `compute_covariance_matrix` loop over BZ dimensions (`total_k_points`). Ensured `apply_disorder` (grid path) correctly uses the BZ index `idx` to fetch `V[idx], Winv[idx]` and calls `_at_kvec_from_miller_points((dh,dk,dl))` (which uses full grid dimensions internally via `self.map_shape`) to get the correct `q_indices` for the structure factor calculation. Simplified `_at_kvec_from_miller_points` by removing internal recalculation of grid steps and relying on `self.map_shape`.

**3. Codebase Conventions Established**

*   **High Precision Default:** For calculations requiring numerical equivalence with NumPy, default to `torch.float64` (`self.real_dtype`) and `torch.complex128` (`self.complex_dtype`). Avoid down-casting in intermediate steps.
*   **NumPy Parity Focus:** When PyTorch functions exhibit subtle numerical differences (e.g., `eigh`, `bmm` with mixed types, NaN handling), prioritize implementations that exactly mimic the NumPy algorithm's steps and behavior, even if it requires manual implementation (like complex `bmm`) or using NumPy itself for specific steps (like grid generation).
*   **Comparative Debugging:** Utilize extensive, side-by-side debug prints comparing intermediate NumPy and PyTorch values (shapes, dtypes, specific elements, stats) to pinpoint divergences.
*   **Phased Verification:** Test foundational components (grid generation, precision, basic matrices) before testing more complex dependent calculations (phonons, covariance, intensity).
*   **Robust Eigenvector Comparison:** When comparing eigenvectors where ordering and phase are arbitrary, compare projection matrices (`V @ V.conj().T`) rather than direct absolute values for a more reliable assessment of eigenspace equivalence.
*   **Clear Indexing:** Maintain a clear distinction in variable names and logic between operations on the Brillouin Zone grid (e.g., using `h_dim_bz`, `k_dim_bz`, `idx`) and the full reciprocal space grid (e.g., using `self.map_shape`, `q_indices`).

**4. Verification Strategy**

*   Direct numerical comparison using `np.allclose` with appropriate tolerances was used at each phase.
*   Tight tolerances (`rtol=1e-12, atol=1e-14`) were used for direct calculations (`Amat`, `M_allatoms`, `hkl_grid`, structure factors).
*   Looser tolerances (`rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-8` or `rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-7`) were used for results involving numerical methods like matrix inversion or eigendecomposition (`Linv`, `V`, `Winv`, `covar`, `ADP`, final `Id`).
*   Dedicated test scripts (`test_phase1_precision.py`, `test_phase2_matrices_scatter.py`, `test_phase3_phonon_covariance.py`) were created for each phase.
*   Intermediate debug prints were heavily relied upon to diagnose issues step-by-step.

**5. Remaining Considerations**

*   **Arbitrary q-vector Mode:** This mode was introduced but its numerical equivalence and gradient flow require separate, dedicated verification.
*   **`nanobind` Leaks:** The test output consistently shows `nanobind` memory leak warnings related to `gemmi`. These are likely unrelated to the numerical equivalence issues addressed here but should be investigated separately as a potential issue in the underlying libraries or their bindings.

**6. Conclusion**

By systematically addressing precision issues, correcting logic discrepancies in matrix calculations, refining the phonon calculation steps (especially the final eigenvector transformation), and ensuring consistent indexing, the numerical regression in the PyTorch **grid-based mode** of `OnePhonon` has been resolved. The PyTorch implementation now produces results computationally equivalent to the original NumPy version within acceptable numerical tolerances, paving the way for reliable gradient-based applications using this mode.
