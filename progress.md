# PyTorch Port Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of the PyTorch port for the diffuse scattering simulation codebase. The implementation follows the phased plan outlined in [phased_plan.md](./phased_plan.md).

## Overall Progress Summary

| Phase | Description | Status | Completion |
|-------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Phase 1 | Core Utilities | In Progress | 77% |
| Phase 2 | Adapter Components | In Progress | 70% |
| Phase 3 | Core Functions | Complete | 100% |
| Phase 4 | OnePhonon Model | In Progress | 73% |
| Phase 5 | Integration | Not Started | 0% |
| **Overall** | **All Phases** | **In Progress** | **69%** |

## Ground Truth Data

âœ… **Ground truth data** has been generated by running `run_np()` with the `@debug` decorators in place

The data is available in the `logs/` directory but is not included in the source control. The logs follow the naming pattern `eryx.module.function.log` and contain serialized inputs and outputs for testing the PyTorch implementations.

### Missing Ground Truth Data

The following function from `to_convert.json` is missing a log file:

1. `eryx.pdb.flatten_model`

Additional debug runs with focused tests may be needed to generate this missing log file.

The log file for `eryx.models.compute_covariance_matrix` has been confirmed to be available, contrary to previous documentation.
