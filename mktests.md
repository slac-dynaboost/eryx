# Specification Template Updated

## High-Level Objective
- Develop a comprehensive automated test suite for the One Phonon Model with integrated log analysis.

## Mid-Level Objectives
- Build and enhance test utilities for capturing and analyzing logs.
- Implement unit tests for core functionalities (e.g., grid setup, matrix operations, and K-vector computations).
- Develop integration tests covering interactions between components (such as AtomicModel, GaussianNetworkModel, etc.) and ensuring correct log generation.
- Design and execute edge case tests to validate error handling and numerical stability.
- Automate log parsing to validate calculation chains and operational sequences.

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies and Requirements
- pytest for test automation.
- numpy for numerical validations.
- Generated logs from previous model runs as reference.
- Custom log parsing utilities (e.g., a LogAnalyzer class) for detailed log analysis.
- YAML (if using configuration files).

### Technical Guidance
- Parse logs to extract method entry/exit info, computation values, and intermediate results.
- Compare extracted values against expected known good values.
- Verify the sequence of operations (logging of entry, exit, and intermediate steps).
- Validate intermediate results and ensure proper error logging.
- Start with small test cases and incrementally build up to integration and edge case scenarios.

## Low-Level Tasks

1. **Create Log Analysis Tools**
```aider
CREATE tests/test_utils/log_analysis.py:
  ADD LogAnalyzer class:
    - Methods:
      - `parse_logs(logs: List[str]) -> dict`: Parse log sequences into a structured format.
      - `extract_values(pattern: str, logs: List[str]) -> List[float]`: Retrieve computation values using regex patterns.
      - `validate_chain(expected: dict, actual: dict) -> bool`: Validate that the log chain matches expected operation sequences.
```

2. **Implement Core Tests**
```aider
CREATE tests/test_onephonon.py:
  ADD TestOnePhonon class:
    - Initialization Tests:
      - Verify parameter processing and grid setup.
      - Check that the model initializes with the correct state.
    - Computation Tests:
      - Validate matrix construction.
      - Confirm K-vector and phonon calculations.
      - Compare computed values against reference outputs.
```

3. **Implement Integration Tests**
```aider
UPDATE tests/test_onephonon.py:
  ADD integration test methods:
    - Test interactions between AtomicModel and GaussianNetworkModel.
    - Confirm that log sequences reflect proper inter-component communication.
```

4. **Implement Edge Case Tests**
```aider
UPDATE tests/test_onephonon.py:
  ADD edge case test methods:
    - Boundary condition tests.
    - Tests for error conditions and numerical precision.
    - Validate that unexpected inputs are logged and handled gracefully.
```
